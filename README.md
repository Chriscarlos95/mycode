I want to learn how to version control projects with git.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project
on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things are needed to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in
"how to install python and python3 using apt."
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Authors

* Chris - *Initial work* - (https://github.com/Chriscarlos95)
